Things we should explain in the seminar:

Environment
	- `make` only compiles files that premake knew about. Run `make clean; premake4` to regenerate Makefile
	- `make` is slow - use `make -j` and only rerun without `-j` if you find errors

Coding
	- the whole types.hpp thing, at least how it's used
