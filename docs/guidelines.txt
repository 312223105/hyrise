Guidelines
- Fail early, fail loud

Coding Style
- avoid new / have clear ownership
	- problem: what about vector.push_back(new xy)
- const
- no nested namespaces
- _name f√ºr member
- no namespace imports (std::)
- comments above code
- int vs. uint(32...)_t
- capitalization for class names?
- include stdlib before 3rdparty before own
- tabs or spaces? currently there is a mix

Todo
- simple performance tool to profile the impact of changes
